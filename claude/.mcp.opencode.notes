OpenCode MCP sharing

- Source of truth: dotfiles/claude/.mcp.json
- install.sh merges this into both:
  - Claude Code: ~/.claude.json (mcpServers)
  - OpenCode: ~/.config/opencode/opencode.json (mcp)

Adding a new MCP server:
1) Edit dotfiles/claude/.mcp.json
2) Re-run dotfiles/install.sh (or rebuild the claude-code container)

Notes:
- OpenCode uses a different schema:
  - type: "local"
  - command: ["uvx", "workspace-mcp", ...]
  - environment: { ... }
- Env vars in .mcp.json are expanded from the current shell when install.sh runs.
