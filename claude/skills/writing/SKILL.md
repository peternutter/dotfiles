# Writing & Humanizing

Write well. Don't sound like a robot. This skill covers both drafting and editing.

## When to Use

- Drafting articles, blog posts, Substack pieces, summaries
- Editing any text to remove AI patterns
- Reviewing writing for quality before publishing
- Converting research notes into readable prose

---

## Part 1: Drafting

### Paragraph Openers
If 3+ paragraphs start with "This/The/It" = robotic. Vary with action verbs, specific nouns, or context-setters. Lead with action: "Marketing increased" not "The marketing team increased."

### Rhythm
Mix sentence lengths. Short punches. Then longer ones that take their time. Use strategic fragments. For emphasis. For pace.

### Specificity Over Vagueness
Replace adjectives with numbers: "significant growth" -> "40% growth."
Swap evaluations for evidence: "impressive results" -> "cut response time from 3s to 300ms."
Delete weasel words: somewhat, fairly, quite, rather, slightly.

### Lists vs Prose
Use prose when explaining relationships or building arguments. Use bullets only for instructions, features, or options. If bullets feel choppy, switch to connected sentences.

### Transitions
Avoid: Furthermore, Moreover, Additionally, In conclusion.
Use the echo technique: end a paragraph with concept X, start the next with concept X. Let ideas flow naturally.

### Voice Consistency
Check every ~200 words: same person speaking? Don't switch from beginner-friendly to expert jargon mid-piece. Pick a register and hold it.

### Word Economy
- "in order to" -> "to"
- "due to the fact that" -> "because"
- "make improvement" -> "improve"
- "conduct investigation" -> "investigate"
- "implementation of" -> "implement"
- 80% rule: can you say it in fewer words? Do it.

### Structure
1. Hook with a surprising observation, question, or specific detail
2. Establish context (brief, don't over-explain)
3. Present the substance with evidence
4. Address complexity or counterpoints
5. Close with a concrete takeaway, not a vague "the future looks bright"

## Part 2: AI Pattern Detection & Removal

Based on Wikipedia's "Signs of AI writing" guide. These patterns appear far more often in AI text than human text.

### Inflated Significance
**Watch for:** "serves as a testament," "pivotal role," "enduring legacy," "underscores the importance," "reflects broader trends," "evolving landscape," "indelible mark," "setting the stage for"

These puff up importance. Replace with specific facts.

Before: "The institute was established in 1989, marking a pivotal moment in the evolution of regional statistics."
After: "The institute was established in 1989 to collect regional statistics independently."

### Promotional Language
**Watch for:** vibrant, rich (figurative), profound, breathtaking, groundbreaking, renowned, nestled, in the heart of, boasts, stunning, must-visit, showcasing, commitment to

Before: "Nestled in the breathtaking region, it stands as a vibrant town with rich cultural heritage."
After: "It's a town in the Gonder region, known for its weekly market and 18th-century church."

### AI Vocabulary (Overused Words)
These words appear far more in AI text than human text. Avoid or minimize:

Additionally, align with, crucial, delve, emphasizing, enduring, enhance, fostering, garner, highlight (verb), interplay, intricate/intricacies, key (adjective), landscape (abstract), pivotal, showcase, tapestry (abstract), testament, underscore (verb), valuable, vibrant

### Superficial -ing Phrases
**Watch for:** "highlighting the importance of...", "ensuring that...", "reflecting the...", "symbolizing the...", "contributing to...", "showcasing..."

These tack fake depth onto sentences. Cut them or make them specific.

Before: "The color palette resonates with the region's beauty, symbolizing the bluebonnets, reflecting the community's deep connection to the land."
After: "The architect chose blue and gold to reference local bluebonnets and the Gulf coast."

### Vague Attributions
**Watch for:** "Industry reports suggest," "Experts argue," "Some critics believe," "Several sources indicate"

Replace with specific sources or cut entirely.

Before: "Experts believe it plays a crucial role in the ecosystem."
After: "A 2019 survey by the Chinese Academy of Sciences found it supports several endemic species."

### Negative Parallelisms
**Watch for:** "Not only...but also...", "It's not just about..., it's about..."

Before: "It's not merely a song, it's a statement."
After: "The heavy beat adds to the aggressive tone."

### Rule of Three
AI forces things into groups of three to sound comprehensive.

Before: "innovation, inspiration, and industry insights"
After: Just say what you actually mean. Two things or four things are fine.

### Copula Avoidance
AI avoids "is/are/has" and substitutes elaborate constructions.

Before: "The gallery serves as LAAA's exhibition space and boasts over 3,000 square feet."
After: "The gallery is LAAA's exhibition space. It has four rooms totaling 3,000 square feet."

### Em Dash Overuse
AI uses em dashes more than humans. Replace most with commas, periods, or parentheses.

### Sycophantic Tone
Remove: "Great question!", "You're absolutely right!", "That's an excellent point!", "I hope this helps!"

### Filler Phrases
- "At this point in time" -> "Now"
- "In the event that" -> "If"
- "It is important to note that" -> (just state the thing)
- "The system has the ability to" -> "The system can"

### Generic Positive Conclusions
Before: "The future looks bright. Exciting times lie ahead as they continue their journey toward excellence."
After: "The company plans to open two more locations next year."

## Part 3: Adding Soul

Avoiding AI patterns is half the job. Sterile, voiceless writing is just as obvious as slop.

### Signs of soulless writing (even if technically clean):
- Every sentence is the same length
- No opinions, just neutral reporting
- No acknowledgment of uncertainty
- No first-person when it would be natural
- Reads like a press release

### How to fix it:
- **Have opinions.** React to facts, don't just report them.
- **Vary rhythm.** Short. Then longer when it serves the argument.
- **Acknowledge complexity.** "This is impressive but also unsettling" beats "This is impressive."
- **Use "I" when it fits.** First person isn't unprofessional.
- **Be specific about reactions.** Not "this is concerning" but "there's something unsettling about agents working at 3am while nobody watches."
- **Let some mess in.** Perfect structure feels algorithmic.

## Process for Editing

1. Read the text aloud (mentally). Does it sound like a person?
2. Scan paragraph openers -- varied or repetitive?
3. Check for AI vocabulary words (the list above)
4. Look for inflated significance and promotional language
5. Verify all claims are specific, not vague
6. Check sentence rhythm -- monotone or varied?
7. Ensure the conclusion says something concrete
8. Final pass: would a smart, opinionated human write this? If not, fix it.
